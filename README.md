💞️ I'm a fullstack developer who is passionate about solving day-to-day challenges, through technology at the same time elevating people, and building community.  </br>

Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, </br>

🌱 I’m currently learning: **Python & Angular** </br>

The idea of being able to get computers to do things my way fascinates me! </br>
